<p>This guide will get you setup with <strong>using bitcoin in a reasonably easy, affordable, and secure way</strong>.  It is best to keep bitcoin <strong>keys offline and never connected to the internet</strong>. Someone would need physical access to steal money, similar to gold secured in a safe. After you get comfortable with this setup you can easily upgrade your security and privacy without changing the software you are using.</p>
<p><strong>this setup is relatively cheap for the security it provides</strong><br>
~$150: coldcard + computer<br>
<strong>~$450: recommended full setup: <a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/bundle-mk4-jims">bundle</a> + <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Reader-Memory-RS-MMC-Micro/dp/B07NW8RPYN/">card reader</a> + <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Luck-Lab-Matching-Numbers-Leather/dp/B097C76XYS/">dice</a> + computer</strong></p>

f. if you have a second coldcard, practice the recovery process by recovering the seed words into the second coldcard, if you did the back up correctly both coldcards should show the same receive addresses</li>

<p>IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>always verify receive addresses on the coldcard <a href="https://youtu.be/KinK1B2u-_s">address explorer</a> going forward</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>make sure to clearly label your receive addresses in Sparrow so you know what their source is when you go to send from them in the future</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>always double check destination and change addresses directly on the coldcard screen during the transaction sending process</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>never connect your coldcard directly to the computer, use a microsd card to transport the data</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>can also be useful to have an additional backup that is a second coldcard already setup with the same wallet</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>always test your backups, consider doing a full restore process on a new device</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>the coldcard is designed to be secure even if your computer is insecure but best practice is to use a dedicated computer with it that you do not use for anything else - if a malicious actor gets access to your computer they can compromise your privacy and potentially steal funds</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>You may want to experiment with a multisig setup using the same software stack as above as you get more comfortable. The nice thing about the above setup is you can easily <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html#the-expert-stage">move to multisig</a> in the future.</strong></em></p>
</li>
</ul>
